A software for ordering video editing services
# 🎬 Lassie – Product Design Case Study

Lassie is a platform that streamlines ordering professional video editing services for content creators, agencies, and brands.

As the sole Product Designer, I led the entire design process — from research to UI.

---

## 🧩 My Role
- UX Research & Flow Mapping
- Wireframing and High-Fidelity UI Design
- Responsive Web Design (Client Dashboard, Order Flows)

---

## 🎯 The Problem
Clients struggled with inconsistent communication and unclear requirements when ordering video editing services through traditional email or chat-based systems.

---

## 💡 The Solution
A centralized platform where users could:
- Submit detailed editing requests with pre-set templates
- Track order progress
- Communicate with editors within a single UI

---

## 🛠️ Design System Highlights
- Color and typography tokens with Figma variables
- Component library with nested auto-layouts
- Responsive components for mobile/tablet/web
- Collaboration with developers to document spacing, states, and interactivity
